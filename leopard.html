        <div class="ltext">Leopards are big cats who live in Africa and Asia. They are usually solitary animals, mostly coming together to mate or when a mother cares for her cubs. They enjoy being in trees and often haul their prey up into branches to enjoy a meal. Leopards are terrific at hiding themselves in plants when attempting to capture prey or hide from other animals. Their conservation status is near threatened because their population is declining due to habitat loss and illegally being hunted for their fur.
